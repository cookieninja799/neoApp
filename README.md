# Near Earth Object Tracker

This project is a Next.js web application for tracking Near Earth Objects (NEOs) using data provided by NASA's NEO Web Service. It offers an interactive dashboard to visualize NEOs that pass near Earth, including their size, velocity, distance, and whether they are potentially hazardous.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: View a summary of today's Near Earth Objects including total count, how many are potentially hazardous, and the closest approach.
- **NEO List**: Detailed list of NEOs with their key characteristics.
- **Orbital Visualization**: Interactive visualization of NEOs' orbital paths (coming soon).
- **Filters**: Filter NEOs based on size, distance, velocity, and hazard status (coming soon).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
